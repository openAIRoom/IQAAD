# IQAAD
Official implementation for the paper "***Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Based on Full-Reference Image Quality Assessment***"

## Descriptions
This project is a [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) implementation of IQAAD. 
We improve two classical FR-IQA metrics, the gradient magnitude similarity deviation(GMSD) and the feature similarity induced metric(FSIM), so they can better haddle the intrinsic difficulties of anomaly detection tasks. In addition, we proposes a memory bank with a new updating stratery.
