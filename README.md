# IQAAD
Official implementation for the paper "***Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Based on Full-Reference Image Quality Assessment***"

## Descriptions
This project is a [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) implementation of IQAAD. This paper improves two classical full-reference image quality assessment(FR-IQA), the gradient magnitude similarity deviation(GMSD) and the feature similarity induced metric(FSIM), which can better haddle the intrinsic difficulties of anomaly detection tasks.

## How To Use This Code
You will need:
  - Python 3.7
  - [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/), version 1.7.0
  - torchvision, version 0.8.0
  - numpy, opencv-python
